To Run Linear model from scratch:

1) run ./data/scripts/regenerate_data.sh
2) run ./full_matrix/create_experiment_matrices.py
3) run ./full_matrix/run_linear_model.py

Results will be deposited in ./full_matrix/results/ 
There is a static method on the class ./resources/LinearModel.py for loading the result (load_from_hdf5)

The excel spreadsheet from the manuscript is included in ./legacy/xls_csv_mat/, in three different representations.
Execute run_linear_model_manuscript.py to fit with the frozen original data.
